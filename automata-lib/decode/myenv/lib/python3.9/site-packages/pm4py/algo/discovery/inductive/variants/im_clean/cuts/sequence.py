def detect(alphabet, transitive_predecessors, transitive_successors):
    '''
    This method finds a xor cut in the dfg.
    Implementation follows function XorCut on page 188 of
    "Robust Process Mining with Guarantees" by Sander J.J. Leemans (ISBN: 978-90-386-4257-4)

    Basic Steps:
    1. create a group per activity
    2. merge pairwise reachable nodes (based on transitive relations)
    3. merge pairwise unreachable nodes (based on transitive relations)
    4. sort the groups based on their reachability
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    alphabet
        characters occurring in the dfg
    transitive_predecessors
        dictionary mapping activities to their (transitive) predecessors, according to the DFG
    transitive_successors
        dictionary mapping activities to their (transitive) successors, according to the DFG

    Returns
    -------
        A list of sets of activities, i.e., forming a maximal sequence cut
        None if no cut is found.

    This method projects the log based on a presumed sequence cut and a list of activity groups
    Parameters
    ----------
    log
        original log
    groups
        list of activity sets to be used in projection (activities can only appear in one group)
    activity_key
        key to use in the event to derive the activity name
